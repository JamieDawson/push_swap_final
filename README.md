<b>Push Swap</b> is an algorithms project I completed at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/).</br>

The idea of the project is that you have two stacks which are called Stack A and Stack B. Stack A can contain 1000+ random numbers. You have to sort Stack A from smallest to largest using only a handful of allowed moves.

I used a optomized version of [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) in order to get the stack sorted.

If you're interested in seeing my logic step by step, then you can [click here to see my Medium article that goes into every detail on how this project works.](https://medium.com/@jamierobertdawson/push-swap-the-least-amount-of-moves-with-two-stacks-d1e76a71789a)
